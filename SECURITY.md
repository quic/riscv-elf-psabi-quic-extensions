How to Report a Potential Vulnerability?
========================================

If you would like to report a public issue (for example, one with a released CVE
number), please report it as a [GitHub
issue](https://github.com/quic/riscv-elf-psabi-quic-extensions/issues/new). If
you have a patch ready, submit it following the same procedure as any other
patch as described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you are dealing with a not-yet released or urgent issue, please contact us
via our [Product
Security](https://www.qualcomm.com/company/product-security/report-a-bug) team,
including as many details as possible: including the version, and any example
code, if available.
